# 🛒 Smart Order Processing & Conditional Email Automation (n8n)

## 📌 Project Overview
This workflow automates order processing using webhook triggers, external API calls, conditional logic, and automated email notifications.

When a new order is received:
1. Data is captured via Webhook
2. External API is called using HTTP Request
3. Data is merged and processed
4. Conditional logic (IF node) evaluates the order
5. Order details are stored in Google Sheets
6. Email notification is sent based on condition
